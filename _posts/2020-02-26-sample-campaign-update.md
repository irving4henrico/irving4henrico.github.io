Dear friends and supporters,

I am running for schoolboard in Henrico County and I am writing to provide an update on my campaign.

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude for your support and encouragement. Your belief in my vision for a more progressive and inclusive education system in Henrico County means the world to me.

Over the past few months, I have been hard at work meeting with community members, educators, and students to listen to their concerns and ideas. I have also been attending school board meetings and learning about the current challenges and opportunities facing our district.

Through these conversations, I have developed a platform that focuses on equity, accountability, and transparency. Some of the key issues I am advocating for include:

- Increasing funding for schools in low-income and underrepresented communities
- Providing more resources and support for teachers and staff
- Improving communication and transparency between the school board and the community
- Strengthening accountability measures to ensure that schools are meeting the needs of all students

I am confident that with your support, we can make real progress towards creating a more equitable and inclusive education system in Henrico County.

Thank you again for your support and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or ideas.

Sincerely,
Madison Irving
