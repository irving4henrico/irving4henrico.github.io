### Priorities

- **Improving academic outcomes for all students**: I will work to ensure that every student in Henrico County has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. This includes addressing issues like the school-to-prison pipeline, disproportionate disciplinary actions, and the impact of systemic racism on student outcomes.
- **Supporting teachers and staff**: I believe that our educators are the backbone of our education system and deserve to be treated with respect and given the resources they need to succeed. I will work to improve teacher pay, benefits, and working conditions, as well as investing in professional development opportunities.
- **Increasing funding for schools**: I will advocate for increased funding from the state and local governments to ensure that our schools have the resources they need to provide a high-quality education to all students.
- **Promoting transparency and accountability**: I will work to ensure that the school board is open, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the community. This includes making budget and decision-making processes more transparent and accessible, and holding schools accountable for meeting the needs of all students.
- **Building strong relationships between schools and the community**: I will prioritize building strong relationships between schools and the communities they serve, including by encouraging parent and student engagement and partnering with local organizations and businesses.
