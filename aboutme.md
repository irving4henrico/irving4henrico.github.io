### My story

Every year, Madison Irving teaches his Personal Fiance and Economics students at Glen Allen High not just how their government works, but how they can use their knowledge to change the world for the better.

Then in 2017 he wanted to take action himself: so he ran for Delegate to serve the Virginia and Henrico County. Now, after five years in the House, he’s ready to take his service to the State Senate’s 16th District.

Schuyler’s career in the classroom and his experiences as a father of three gave him a firsthand look at the issues facing everyday families in his district. In the House of Delegates, Schuyler has worked tirelessly to ensure that Virginia remains a leader in public education. He also is proud of his work to expand access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, to pass common-sense gun safety legislation, to increase access to the ballot box, and to make Virginia an inclusive place for all to live.

In the Senate, he is excited to be able to have an even greater impact on legislation to improve our public schools, so that all children in the Commonwealth have access to a world-class education, and to work harder than ever to open economic opportunities for all Virginians.

Over the next four years, Schuyler will continue to deliver on the issues that he knows matter most to families in Henrico County.
